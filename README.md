# IPSEmu

This is an attempt at a SNES emulator written in C#. I have it here for archival purposes and for reference for me. The project is discontinued.

It doesn't support Sprites and doesn't support the Sound CPU either so don't expect it to run commercial games. It only supports most of the CPU and the PPU.
